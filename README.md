# U.S. Power Plants: CO‚ÇÇ Emissions & Energy Generation (2016)

This Python project analyzes the 2016 eGRID dataset to explore electricity production and carbon emissions in the United States. It answers a series of data-driven questions about power plant performance, fuel types, and environmental impact using pandas.

This project was completed as part of the **IBM Python Project for Data Engineering** course and demonstrates skills in exploratory data analysis, query formulation, and environmental data handling.

## üìÅ Dataset

The data used is `egrid2016.csv`, sourced from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) [Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID)](https://www.epa.gov/energy/emissions-generation-resource-integrated-database-egrid).

### Columns Used:

| Column      | Description                                           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `PNAME`     | Plant name                                            |
| `PSTATABB`  | State abbreviation                                     |
| `LAT`       | Plant latitude                                         |
| `PLPRMFL`   | Primary fuel type (e.g., NG, BIT, WND, etc.)           |
| `NAMEPCAP`  | Nameplate capacity (in Megawatts)                      |
| `PLNGENAN`  | Annual net electricity generation (in MWh)            |
| `PLCO2EQA`  | Annual CO‚ÇÇ equivalent emissions (in tons)             |

## üß™ Questions Answered

The script answers the following queries:

1. Which power plant generated the most energy (MWh)?
2. Which power plant produced the most CO‚ÇÇ emissions (tons)?
3. In which state is the plant with the most CO‚ÇÇ emissions located?
4. What is the primary fuel of the plant with the most CO‚ÇÇ emissions?
5. What is the northernmost power plant (based on latitude)?
6. In which state is the northernmost power plant located?
7. Which state has the highest number of hydroelectric plants?
8. How many hydroelectric plants are in that state?
9. Which state(s) generated the most energy using coal?
10. How much coal-generated energy was produced in total (MWh)?
11. Which states have **exactly one** coal plant?
12. Which **fuel category** produced the most CO‚ÇÇ emissions in total?

To answer Q12, individual fuel types were grouped into broader categories:

- **COAL**: BIT, LIG, RC, SUB, WC  
- **OIL**: DFO, JF, KER, RFO, WO  
- **GAS**: BFG, COG, LFG, NG, OG, PG, PRG  
- **RENEW**: GEO, SUN, WAT, WDL, WDS, WND
